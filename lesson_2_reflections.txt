When I initialize a repository, it creates a .git folder in that repository which is used to identify whether it is a git repository or not.if we know the goal and doesn't know whether the path chosen by you is right or wrong we can use the branching in git.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do? Ans: It will create a master branch which contains the both children branches code.
